# EmployWise Assignment

This is a React application that integrates with the Reqres API to perform basic user management functions, including user authentication, displaying a list of users, and providing features to search and filter users.

## Features

### Level 1: Authentication Screen
- **Login Functionality**: A basic authentication screen where the user can log in using the credentials:
  - Email: `eve.holt@reqres.in`
  - Password: `cityslicka`
- On successful login, the user is redirected to the Users List page.
  
### Level 2: List All Users
- After logging in, users are displayed in a paginated list.
- Each userâ€™s first name, last name, and avatar are shown in a structured layout.
- Pagination is implemented to navigate through multiple pages of users.

### Bonus Points:
- **Client-side search and filtering**: Users can search and filter the displayed list of users.
- **React Router for navigation**: The app uses React Router to navigate between pages (Login and User List).
